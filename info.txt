step() accepts actions and returns four values:
- observation (object)
- reward (float)
- done (boolean)
- info (dict)

define an action space and an observation space

observation space may include:
- self pokemon hp
- self party pokemon hp
- opponent current hp
- opponent party pokemon hp


define the reward (win is 1, loss is 0?)
- do we take into account hp delta between self and opponent for reward?

implement mega and zmove in action space

implement past memory (pokemon moves, items, abilities, stats?)

implement pokemon data (pokemon stats, move power, item effects?)

render...?

action space:
- 4 moves
- 5 switches (assuming using 6 pokemons)
- 1 mega (can combine with moves x 4)
- 1 z-move (can combine with moves x 4)
